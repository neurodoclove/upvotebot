# upvotebot
Discord bot that uses emojis to generate a top 10 list of the most 'upvoted' clips in a channel

Setup is simple.  After inviting the bot to the server, decide which channel you'd like the bot to watch.  Then run !setchannel #channel-name to set the channel.  

To see a top 10 list run !top10.  

Want a different emoji?  Just replace the 'star' with whatever you like in the code.
